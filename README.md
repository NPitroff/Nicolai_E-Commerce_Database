## NICOLAI PITROFF E-COMMERCE BACKEND SERVER PROJECT

## PROJECT GOALS
TO CREATE A SERVER FIT TO BE USED BY A COMMERCE WEBSITE OR BUSINESS TO STORE RELEVANT INFORMATION ON THEIR PRODUCTS

IT LINKS TOGETHER NOT ONLY THE ENTIRE INVENTORY, BUT RELEVANT "TAG" DATA TO GROUP TOGETHER LIKE PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS LIKE "CATEGORIES"

## TASKS ACCOMPLISHED

I CREATED 'REST'-FUL ROUTES FOR EACH TABLE STORED IN THE DATABASE WITH THE FUNCTIONALITY TO:

-FIND ALL DATA WITHIN THE TABLE

-FIND DATA MATCHING A PARTICULAR 'ID'

-CREATE NEW DATA IN THE TABLE

-UPDATE DATA IN THE TABLE

-DELETE DATA IN THE TABLE

## STEPS 
ALL OF THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED USING 'MYSQL' FUNCTIONALITY WITHIN THE NODE APPLICATION ONCE THE DATABASE WAS CREATED IN THE 'MYSQL' WORKBENCH. I THEN USED 'INSOMNIA CORE' TO EXECUTE ALL OF THE 'GET', 'PUT', & 'DELETE' REQUESTS.
